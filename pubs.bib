abstract = {At some stage in the origin of life, an informational polymer must have arisen by purely chemical means. According to one version of the RNA world hypothesis this polymer was RNA, but attempts to provide experimental support for this have failed. In particular, although there has been some success demonstrating that activated ribonucleotides can polymerize to form RNA, it is far from obvious how such ribonucleotides could have formed from their constituent parts (ribose and nucleobases). Ribose is difficult to form selectively, and the addition of nucleobases to ribose is inefficient in the case of purines and does not occur at all in the case of the canonical pyrimidines. Here we show that activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides can be formed in a short sequence that bypasses free ribose and the nucleobases, and instead proceeds through arabinose amino-oxazoline and anhydronucleoside intermediates. The starting materials for the synthesiscyanamide, cyanoacetylene, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde and inorganic phosphateare plausible prebiotic feedstock molecules, and the conditions of the synthesis are consistent with potential early-Earth geochemical models. Although inorganic phosphate is only incorporated into the nucleotides at a late stage of the sequence, its presence from the start is essential as it controls three reactions in the earlier stages by acting as a general acid/base catalyst, a nucleophilic catalyst, a pH buffer and a chemical buffer. For prebiotic reaction sequences, our results highlight the importance of working with mixed chemical systems in which reactants for a particular reaction step can also control other steps. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Living organisms are the most complex chemical system known to exist, yet they exploit only a small constellation of universally conserved metabolites to support indefinite evolution. The chemical unity that belies biodiversity strongly indicates a unified origin of life predicated by a simple set of predisposed chemical reactions. If prebiotic chemistry is prone to produce highly complex mixtures that do not reflect life's underlying unity, this then implies that the feasibility of elucidating life's origins might be an insurmountable task. However, recently, prebiotic systems chemistry has emerged to exploit the chemical links between different metabolites, providing unprecedented scope for exploration of the origins of life and an exciting new perspective on a four-billion-year-old problem. At the heart of this systems approach is an understanding that individual classes of metabolites cannot be considered in isolation, and this review highlights some recent advances that suggest that canonical metabolites are predisposed chemical structures.},

Despite their potentially key role as precursors of astrobiologically important molecules, such as amino acids and carboxylic acids, this family of compounds has scarcely been evaluated in carbonaceous chondrites. The paucity of such analyses likely derives from the low concentration of aldehydes and ketones in the meteorites and from the currently used chromatographic methodologies that have not been optimized for meteorite analysis. In this work, we report the development of a novel analytical method to quantify the molecular distribution and compound-specific isotopic analysis of 29 aliphatic aldehydes and ketones. Using this method, we have investigated the molecular distribution and 13C-isotopic composition of aldehydes and ketones in 10 carbonaceous chondrites from the CI, CM, CR, and CV groups. The total concentration of carbonyl compounds ranged from 130 to 1000 nmol g-1 of meteorite with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone being the most abundant species in all investigated samples. The 13C-isotopic values ranged from {\^{a}}67 to +64‰ and we did not observe clear relationships between 13C-content and molecular weight. Accurately measuring the relative abundances, determining the molecular distribution, and isotopic composition of chondritic organic compounds is central in assessing both their formation chemistry and synthetic relationships.},

To address this problem, and further explore prebiotically accessible chemical systems, we have developed a high-yielding, aqueous, one-pot, multicomponent reaction that tethers masked-sugar moieties to prebiotically plausible purine precursors. A pH-dependent three-component reaction system has been discovered that utilizes key nucleotide synthons 2-aminooxazole and 5-aminoimidazoles, which allows the first divergent purine/pyrimidine synthesis to be proposed.

Here we show that the 2′-hydroxyl group of oligoribonucleotide-3′-phosphates can be chemoselectively acetylated in water under prebiotically credible conditions, which allows rapid and efficient template-directed ligation. The 2′-O-acetyl group at the ligation junction of the product RNA strand can be removed under conditions that leave the internucleotide bonds intact. Remarkably, acetylation of mixed oligomers that possess either 2′- or 3′-terminal phosphates is selective for the 2′-hydroxyl group of the latter.

abstract = {A variety of macromolecules and small molecules-(oligo)nucleotides, proteins, lipids and metabolites- are collectively considered essential to early life. However, previous schemes for the origin of life-e.g. the 'RNA world' hypothesis-have tended to assume the initial emergence of life based on one such molecular class followed by the sequential addition of the others, rather than the emergence of life based on a mixture of all the classes of molecules. This view is in part due to the perceived implausibility of multi-component reaction chemistry producing such a mixture. The concept of systems chemistry challenges such preconceptions by suggesting the possibility of molecular synergism in complex mixtures. If a systems chemistry method to make mixtures of all the classes of molecules considered essential for early life were to be discovered, the significant conceptual difficulties associated with pure RNA, protein, lipid or metabolism 'worlds' would be alleviated. Knowledge of the geochemical conditions conducive to the chemical origins of life is crucial, but cannot be inferred from a planetary sciences approach alone. Instead, insights from the organic reactivity of analytically accessible chemical subsystems can inform the search for the relevant geochemical conditions. If the common set of conditions under which these subsystems work productively, and compatibly, matches plausible geochemistry, an origins of life scenario can be inferred. Using chemical clues from multiple subsystems in this way is akin to triangulation, and constitutes a novel approach to discover the circumstances surrounding the transition from chemistry to biology. Here, we exemplify this strategy by finding common conditions under which chemical subsystems generate nucleotides and lipids in a compatible and potentially synergistic way. The conditions hint at a post-meteoritic impact origin of life scenario. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Amide bond formation is one of the most important reactions in both chemistry and biology1–4, but there is currently no chemical method of achieving $\alpha$-peptide ligation in water that tolerates all of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids at the peptide ligation site. The universal genetic code establishes that the biological role of peptides predates life's last universal common ancestor and that peptides played an essential part in the origins of life5–9. The essential role of sulfur in the citric acid cycle, non-ribosomal peptide synthesis and polyketide biosynthesis point towards thioester-dependent peptide ligations preceding RNA-dependent protein synthesis during the evolution of life5,9–13. However, a robust mechanism for aminoacyl thioester formation has not been demonstrated13. Here we report a chemoselective, high-yielding $\alpha$-aminonitrile ligation that exploits only prebiotically plausible molecules—hydrogen sulfide, thioacetate12,14 and ferricyanide12,14–17 or cyanoacetylene8,14—to yield $\alpha$-peptides in water. The ligation is extremely selective for $\alpha$-aminonitrile coupling and tolerates all of the 20 proteinogenic amino acid residues. Two essential features enable peptide ligation in water: the reactivity and pKaH of $\alpha$-aminonitriles makes them compatible with ligation at neutral pH and N-acylation stabilizes the peptide product and activates the peptide precursor to (biomimetic) N-to-C peptide ligation. Our model unites prebiotic aminonitrile synthesis and biological $\alpha$-peptides, suggesting that short N-acyl peptide nitriles were plausible substrates during early evolution.},

Consequently, it is an essential intermediate in a wide variety of biochemical pathways, including carbon fixation, the shikimate pathway, substrate-level phosphorylation, gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Triose glycolysis (generation of ATP from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via phosphoenol pyruvate) is among the most central and highly conserved pathways in metabolism. Here, we demonstrate the efficient and robust synthesis of phosphoenol pyruvate from prebiotic nucleotide precursors, glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde. Furthermore, phosphoenol pyruvate is derived within an $\alpha$-phosphorylation controlled reaction network that gives access to glyceric acid 2-phosphate, glyceric acid 3-phosphate, phosphoserine and pyruvate. Our results demonstrate that the key components of a core metabolic pathway central to energy transduction and amino acid, sugar, nucleotide and lipid biosyntheses can be reconstituted in high yield under mild, prebiotically plausible conditions.},

A key step in this route necessitates the regioselective phosphorylation of the secondary alcohol on C 3′ of an anhydroarabinonucleoside in the presence of the primary alcohol on C 5′. Here, we propose that this regioselectivity relies on electron delocalization between a lone pair (n) of O 5′ and an antibonding orbital ($\pi$ *) of C2=N 3. This n→$\pi$ * interaction modulates reactivity without the use of a protecting group.

However, all known conditions for the chemical copying of an RNA template result in the synthesis of a complementary strand that contains a mixture of 2′-5′ and 3′-5′ linkages, rather than the selective synthesis of only 3′-5′ linkages as found in contemporary RNA. Here we show that such backbone heterogeneity is compatible with RNA folding into defined three-dimensional structures that retain molecular recognition and catalytic properties and, therefore, would not prevent the evolution of functional RNAs such as ribozymes. Moreover, the same backbone heterogeneity lowers the melting temperature of RNA duplexes that would otherwise be too stable for thermal strand separation. By allowing copied strands to dissociate, this heterogeneity may have been one of the essential features that allowed RNA to emerge as the first biopolymer. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

However, this synthesis has led to a disparity in the methodology available for stepwise construction of the canonical pyrimidine and purine nucleotides. To address this problem, and further explore prebiotically accessible chemical systems, we have developed a high-yielding, aqueous, one-pot, multicomponent reaction that tethers masked-sugar moieties to prebiotically plausible purine precursors. A pH-dependent three-component reaction system has been discovered that utilizes key nucleotide synthons 2-aminooxazole and 5-aminoimidazoles, which allows the first divergent purine/pyrimidine synthesis to be proposed. Due to regiospecific aminoimidazole tethering, the pathway allows N9 purination only, thus suggesting the first prebiotically plausible mechanism for regiospecific N9 purination. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A central problem for the prebiotic synthesis of biological amino acids and nucleotides is to avoid the concomitant synthesis of undesired or irrelevant by-products. Additionally, multistep pathways require mechanisms that enable the sequential addition of reactants and purification of intermediates that are consistent with reasonable geochemical scenarios. Here, we show that 2-aminothiazole reacts selectively with two- and three-carbon sugars (glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde, respectively), which results in their accumulation and purification as stable crystalline aminals. This permits ribonucleotide synthesis, even from complex sugar mixtures. Remarkably, aminal formation also overcomes the thermodynamically favoured isomerization of glyceraldehyde into dihydroxyacetone because only the aminal of glyceraldehyde separates from the equilibrating mixture. Finally, we show that aminal formation provides a novel pathway to amino acids that avoids the synthesis of the non-proteinogenic $\alpha$,$\alpha$-disubstituted analogues. The common physicochemical mechanism that controls the proteinogenic amino acid and ribonucleotide assembly from prebiotic mixtures suggests that these essential classes of metabolite had a unified chemical origin.},

Consideration of the constitutional chemical relationships between glycolaldehyde and $\beta$-mercapto-acetaldehyde, and the corresponding proteinogenic amino acids, serine and cysteine, led us to explore the consequences of the corresponding sulfur substitution for our previously proposed pathways leading to the canonical ribonucleotides. We demonstrate that just as 2-aminooxazole-an important prebiotic ribonucleotide precursor-is readily formed from glycolaldehyde and cyanamide, so is 2-aminothiazole formed from $\beta$-mercapto-acetaldehyde and cyanamide in water at neutral pH. Indeed, both the oxazole and the thiazole can be formed together in a one-pot reaction, and can be co-purified by crystallization or sublimation. We then show that 2-aminothiazole can take part in a 3-component carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction in water that leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of masked 2′-thiosugars regiospecifically tethered to purine precursors, which would lead to 2′-deoxynucleotides upon desulfurization. The possibility of an abiotic route to the 2′-deoxynucleotides provides a new perspective on the evolutionary origins of DNA. We also show that 2-aminothiazole is able to sequester, through reversible aminal formation, the important nucleotide precursors glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde in a stable, crystalline form. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

Moreover, the prebiotic syntheses of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides that have been demonstrated operate under mutually incompatible conditions. Here, we tackle this mutual incompatibility by recognizing that the 8-oxo-purines share an underlying generational parity with the pyrimidine nucleotides. We present a divergent synthesis of pyrimidine and 8-oxo-purine nucleotides starting from a common prebiotic precursor that yields the $\beta$-ribo-stereochemistry found in the sugar phosphate backbone of biological nucleic acids. The generational relationship between pyrimidine and 8-oxo-purine nucleotides suggests that 8-oxo-purine ribonucleotides may have played a key role in primordial nucleic acids prior to the emergence of the canonical nucleotides of biology.},

Firstly, we discuss prebiotic phosphorylation reactions; we specifically contrast aqueous electrophilic phosphorylation, and aqueous nucleophilic phosphorylation strategies, with dry-state phosphorylations that are mediated by dissociative phosphoryl-transfer. Secondly, we discuss the non-structural roles that phosphates can play in prebiotic chemistry. Here, we focus on the mechanisms by which phosphate has guided prebiotic reactivity through catalysis or buffering effects, to facilitating selective transformations in neutral water. Several prebiotic routes towards the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and core metabolites, that have been facilitated or controlled by phosphate acting as a general acid–base catalyst, pH buffer, or a chemical buffer, are outlined. These facile and subtle mechanisms for incorporation and exploitation of phosphates to orchestrate selective, robust prebiotic chemistry, coupled with the central and universally conserved roles of phosphates in biochemistry, provide an increasingly clear message that understanding phosphate chemistry will be a key element in elucidating the origins of life on Earth.},

Peptide biosynthesis is orchestrated by a complex suite of enzymes in extant biology, but this must have been predated by a simple chemical synthesis at the origins of life. $\alpha$-Aminonitriles, the nitrile precursors of $\alpha$-amino acids, are generally readily produced by Strecker reactions, but the origin of cysteine-the thiol-bearing amino acid-is not understood. The aminothiol moiety of cysteine is chemically incompatible with nitriles at physiological pH, therefore cysteine nitrile is not stable, and it is widely believed that cysteine was a biological invention and a late addition to the genetic code. Here, we report the first high-yielding, prebiotic synthesis of cysteine peptides. Our biomimetic synthesis converts serine to cysteine, bypassing the Strecker reaction of $\beta$-mercaptoacetaldehyde, but exploits nitrile-activated dehydroalanine synthesis at near-neutral pH. We additionally demonstrate the catalytic prowess of N-acylcysteines (and related peptides and thiols) in the organocatalytic synthesis of peptides and peptidyl amidines in neutral water. Thiol catalysis directly couples kinetically stable-but energy-rich-$\alpha$-amidonitriles to proteinogenic amines, in a reaction that tolerates all twenty proteinogenic side chains. This is a rare, prebiotically plausible example of selective and efficient organocatalysis in water. Our results implicate cysteine derivatives and thiol-catalysis at the onset of evolution.
